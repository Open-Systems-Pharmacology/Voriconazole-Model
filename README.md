# Voriconazole-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of voriconazole as CYP2C19 substrate (pharmacogenomics analysis) and usalke as CYP3A4 perpetrator drug

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of a published clinical study used to evaluate the descriptive and predictive performance of the voriconazole model, including the observed data digitized from literature reports. The voriconazole model has been published previously [[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40262-019-00856-z)].
Additionally, a PK-Sim snapshot (\*.json) file of the current PBPK model created with PK-Sim version 9.1 is provided.

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
